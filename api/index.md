# Description
The API consists of a [Client](xref:Scuttlebutt.Crypto.SHS.Client) class and a
[Server](xref:Scuttlebutt.Crypto.SHS.Server) class:
  - The Client, knowing the server's public key, initiates the connection.
  - The Server ultimately proves his identity after confirming the client's.
